# Rules

### The following standards apply to new maps when they are considered by the Map Approval Team for the global map pool.

1. Must have working start and end timers/timer zones, be completable in at least one mode, and all timers/timer zones must be indicated and/or reasonably discoverable.
2. Must be finished with a reasonable display of effort (textured, well lit, evidence of design process, no performance issues).
3. Must not use clips, non-solid blocks, triggers or moving blocks unintuitively or in an exploitable fashion.
4. Must not require additional players or pre-run setup to speed run competitively.
5. Must not be able to skip a significant portion of the map with 'timer tech' at the start or end.
6. Must not contain obscene or sexually explicit content in view of any course.
7. Map submissions must be made by the original mapper unless explicit permission has been given or the mapper cannot be reached by any reasonable means.
8. Must not have too similar of a name to an existing map, regardless of its global status.
9. Must have ["Course Start" support](https://bitbucket.org/kztimerglobalteam/gokz/src/master/MAPPING.md) for the main course and any bonus courses.
10. Must have a jump-stats area accessible from the start of the map with four LJ blocks or more. This standard can be met by using any of [these completed rooms](https://cdn.gokz.org/resource/js-prefabs.zip) in your map.

The following standards also apply to purely aesthetic (non-gameplay) updates of maps.
1. Must be made with permission from the original mapper (or by the original mapper).
2. Must not change the gameplay of any existing courses e.g. adjusting distances of jumps.

## Additional Notes

The Map Approval Team may request miscellaneous changes be made to improve the quality of the map before approving it.

A purely aesthetic (non-gameplay) update of a map will replace the previous version if it is approved.

If a major map issue is found that the Map Approval Team feels should be fixed, the mapper will be contacted and made aware of the issue. In the case of map skips, the mapper will decide whether the skip will be fixed or not, we will make attempts to contact them through reasonable means, and honor their decision. The mapper will have one week to respond, and three days to make a decision. Alternatively, in rare situations the mapper can opt to fix it and have both versions be global, the decision of which maps need this kind of treatment will be at the discretion of the Map Approval Team.

Map creators may request for their global map(s) to be removed from the map pool. To make a request, start a private discussion with the Map Approval Team titled the name of the map and provide reasoning for the request. Additional verification that you are the mapper may be required.
