# Map Approval

Having your map globally approved means it'll be put into a global map list making it possible for players to compete against each others globally on the map. You can find examples of this behaviour on [GOKZStats](https://gokzstats.com) for example.

**NOTE:** Only the mapper can request for their map to be globalled.

1. Mapper starts map and considers <a :href="$withBase('/map/rules')">The Global Map Standards</a>
2. Mapper releases test versions and has someone test it. Maybe the [KZ Mapping discord](https://discord.gg/uuxesuC), thread on the forums or the [CSGO KZ discord](https://discord.gg/csgokz).
3. Mapper feels their map is done and uploads it to the workshop. [Tutorial.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_OWul0E4dY)
4. Mapper goes to [the forums](http://forum.gokz.org) and submit their map. Read how to below.
5. Map Approval Group test the map.
6. Map Approval Group votes on the map and sets the tier.
7. The Mega thread gets updated with results and reasons why if rejected. The same information will also be sent in the global submission thread.
8. If the map got rejected: **Go back to step 2.**
9. Map gets included in the next available batch.

If you don't know which modes it's possible on, just say that.


**What are courses?**
Let’s say you have one main start and end timer, and two bonus start and end timers you would have 3 courses.
Tier is a number between 1-6 where 1 is the easiest and 6 is the hardest. Follow this guide if you’re not sure.

1. _Someone who just knows how to air strafe can complete these maps._
2. _Requires basic knowledge of other KZ mechanics like longjumping, bhop, ladders, surfs._
3. _Anything in between. New players may get stuck but can finish with help/perseverance._
4. _Intended for experienced players only. Starts really requiring strafes and 'basic' tech._
5. _Experienced players may get stuck. Requires decent knowledge of advanced techniques._
6. _Challenge maps requiring well-executed tech, high quality strafes and/or everything else throughout._
7. _Requires near flawless execution and technical precision throughout, employs any and all advanced techniques._
